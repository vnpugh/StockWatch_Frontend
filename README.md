<h2>Running the Application</h2>
To run the StockWatch application, follow these steps:
<ol>
  <li>Clone the repository: Start by cloning the StockWatch repository to your local machine. This can be done using the Git clone command in your preferred terminal.</li>
  <li>Set up the backend API: Open your code editor, preferably Visual Studio Code, and navigate to the main (root) folder of the project. Use the appropriate tools, such as IntelliJ or Tomcat, to run the backend API server.</li>
  <li>Launch the frontend server: Open your command line interface (e.g., Bash, PowerShell) and navigate to the main folder of the StockWatch project. Use the command 'ng serve --open' to launch the Angular server. This will open your default web browser and take you to the application at localhost:4200.</li>
  <li>Ensure both servers are running: It's important to note that StockWatch consists of two separate applications: the Backend API and the Frontend. Make sure you have both servers running simultaneously. Verify that the backend API server is running in your chosen IDE or server environment, while the Angular server is active in your terminal.</li>
</ol>
<p>By following these steps, you will have both the Backend API and the Frontend server up and running. This will allow you to access the StockWatch application through your web browser and begin utilizing its features.</p>

<h2>Frontend Project Approach:desktop_computer:</h2>
<p>In developing StockWatch, my strategic approach involved prioritizing the backend implementation to ensure the core functionality of the application was effectively implemented as a minimum viable product. Once the backend functionality was established, I dedicated my attention to refining and enhancing the frontend user interface.</p>

<p>After selecting a project topic, I began to create the wireframes for the login, registration, and home page:</p>

<center><img align="center" width="300" height="200" src="StockWatch/assets/home_wireframe.png" alt=""></center>

<p>After completing the wireframes, I created the logo for StockWatch in Canva to save time on styling:</p>

<p>To optimize development time and maintain a consistent and professional design, I leveraged popular frontend frameworks such as Bootstrap, Daisy UI, and Angular Material. These frameworks provided a solid foundation for creating visually appealing and responsive components, including forms, tables, buttons, and the navigation bar.

<h2>What I learned/Wins:brain:</h2>
<p>When it came to styling, I embraced the opportunity to enhance the user experience by leveraging Angular Material. By incorporating Angular Material's comprehensive suite of pre-designed components, I was able to effortlessly add visually appealing forms, buttons, and tables/grids to the project pages. The extensive collection of Material design components provided me with the tools needed to create custom components with consistent and intuitive interaction patterns. This allowed me to elevate the aesthetics and functionality of the application, ensuring a seamless and engaging user interface.
